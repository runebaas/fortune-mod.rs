# Fortune-mod (in rust)

This is a clone of the original `fortune` command found on many unix systems

It's primarily an educational project in which i aim to completely reimplement the command.

### Progress

- [x] Print a fortune from a fortunes file
- [x] Specify a cutoff for what is considered a short fortune (the `-n` flag)
- [x] Specify whether a short or a long fortune should be printed (the `-l` flag)
- [x] Wait n amount of seconds before the program exits (the `-w` flag)
- [ ] Allow multiple fortune cookie files
- [ ] Allow to filter with a pattern (the `-m` flag)
- [ ] Ignore case for the pattern (the `-i` flag)
